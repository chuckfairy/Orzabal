  * Handle a quote as the last character of a long string literal in the
    writer (by escaping it) rather than the reader, to avoid writing Turtle
    other tools fail to parse.
  * Add serd_strtod(), serd_node_new_decimal(), and serd_node_new_integer()
    for locale-independent numeric node parsing/serialising.
  * Add serd_file_sink for easy writing to a FILE* stream.

  * Implement pretty-printing for collections.
  * Parse collections iteratively in O(1) space.
  * Report read error if both "genid" and "docid" IDs are found in the same
    document, to prevent silent merging of distinct blank nodes.
  * Handle files and strings that start with a UTF-8 Byte Order Mark.

  * Add serd_node_new_file_uri() and serd_file_uri_parse() and implement
    proper URI to/from path hex escaping, etc.
  * Add serd_uri_serialise_relative() for making URIs relative to a base
    where possible (by chopping a common prefix and adding dot segments).
  * Make URIs serialised by the writer properly escape characters.
  * Add serd_writer_set_root_uri() and corresponding -r option to serdi to
    enable writing URIs with up references (../).
